I understand that Azithromycin resistance is occurring at a staggering rate because it is the most overprescribed antibiotic since 2011. 5. I am not biased regarding therapy.

Ive had some good doctors, and some really awful ones. I do all the research I can on my problem before I go to the doctor so that I can best explain my symptoms and have some understanding of the potential diagnoses. On at least a half-dozen occasions Ive gone in with a complaint and before I had even finished describing my symptoms the doctor had clearly already made up their mind and grabbed the lowest hanging diagnostic fruit around. Even though I knew enough to know they were wrong (because of other symptoms I had not even gotten to yet), they wrote a script and were out the door. After a failed initial treatment and another doctor visit (and copay), they finally listened enough to figure things out - usually. On one occasion I actually paid out of pocket and ordered a lab test online that my doctor declined to perform which finally shed light on the problem.Medical knowledge is increasing at far too fast a pace for most doctors to stay up to date on the latest research, treatments - and probably most important in my case - anecdotal evidence from people discussing their problems and solutions in forums on the internet. Too often there is clear evidence of off-label uses for meds or novel treatments that havent been deemed a big enough money makers for anyone to fund the research that might lead to them being accepted as legitimate. Doesnt change the fact that it might work.Our doctors are overworked, dont have enough time to properly examine and listen to patients and often due to arrogance or just time constraints go for the easy answer and wind up misdiagnosing ailments. Many doctors do try to take the time and appreciate when patients are somewhat knowledgeable about the possibilities, but others get their ego bent out of shape if you try to have an actual discussion and maybe even offer other explanations if it seems right.At the end of the day, anyone who blindly takes their doctors diagnoses without trying to educate themselves is risking quite a lot. You choose the doctor, not the other way around, and it is your health and your life on the line - so if your service provider isnt providing you with what you feel is competent and expert service, get rid of them and find one who will.I DONT mean self diagnose and then doc shop until you find one who agrees, but I think being informed and taking responsibility for your health, including not treating doctors like Gods but rather as the highly educated mortals they are provides you with the best chance of receiving the care that you need.

Doctors SHOULD be a repository of exclusive knowledge (to a point) because the average person who hasnt gone to medical school and hasnt studied for 8 years plus residency doesnt know enough and hasnt learned enough to be able to make an informed decision. Doctors can take certain information and put it into the context of not only that 8+ years of training, but their lifetime of medical experience as well. The average person can only rely on anecdotal evidence and cant contextualize the information theyre seeing. A lot of the time, youll see people with issues that have gotten far worse than they originally were because they tried to google the symptoms and were sure they found the problem.Ill give some anecdotal evidence (yea I see the irony here). I work in veterinary medicine. A client came in with his cat and was saying he was sure she had an abscess and he was going to lance it but wanted to make sure. This abscess was going on for a few months. The second he doctor and I looked at it, we knew it was cancer without a doubt. To see the extent of it, we took an x-ray. It spread to the lungs. This cat would be dead within a few months.People like this arent rare either. I see clients all the time who thought something wasnt a big deal because they googled it. Little did they know that cats develop hepatic lipidosis if they dont eat for more than a couple days.

BTW, having those tubes removed felt like taking a sucker punch from Mike Tyson to the stomach, because I was awake when they were ripped out by the doctor. Ruined my summer too. Now I have a scar several inches long, but I would have gotten away with a much smaller scar (less than an inch long) if I had been treated sooner before my appendix fucking   bursted.I told them I had appendicitis, I explained I was experiencing all the symptoms.

Especially before you get to more modern militaries with lightweight firearms being the primary weapon of choice versus manual weapons like swords, spears, hammers, and axes that require lots of upper body strength to do any real damage to opponents. Making an argument for realism in an already unrealistic condition is self-defeating fairly quickly. Yeah, fine, chainmail bikinis are unrealistic. But so is Red Sonja or Brienne of Tarth (and Brienne at least, is acknowledged as an extreme outlier in both physicality and role in her own world).

She hunted for a book in the airport shops, bought a bag of cookies and found a place to drop.She was engrossed in her book but happened to see, that the man sitting beside her, as bold as could be. . .grabbed a cookie or two from the bag in between, which she tried to ignore to avoid a scene.So she munched the cookies and watched the clock, as the gutsy cookie thief diminished her stock. She was getting more irritated as the minutes ticked by, thinking, “If I wasn’t so nice, I would blacken his eye.”With each cookie she took, he took one too, when only one was left, she wondered what he would do. With a smile on his face, and a nervous laugh, he took the last cookie and broke it in half.He offered her half, as he ate the other, she snatched it from him and thought… oooh, brother. This guy has some nerve and he’s also rude, why he didn’t even show any gratitude!She had never known when she had been so galled, and sighed with relief when her flight was called. She gathered her belongings and headed to the gate, refusing to look back at the thieving ingrate.She boarded the plane, and sank in her seat, then she sought her book, which was almost complete. As she reached in her baggage, she gasped with surprise, there was her bag of cookies, in front of her eyes.If mine are here, she moaned in despair, the others were his, and he tried to share. Too late to apologize, she realized with grief, that she was the rude one, the ingrate, the thief.

Everyone has pride, even when their lives seem to be much worse than ours. Even though things may be much more controlled and other people may have much less freedom than what we have in our country doesn’t mean that people in shitty countries will welcome foreign invaders with open arms to “free” them with military force and violence. That is arrogance and stupidity. We should have learned that lesson in Viet Nam. If we act antagonistic and threatening to other human beings, they WILL get angry and hateful towards us and commit acts of violence in retaliation, and it doesn’t matter if they are being controlled by a violent, spoiled, and ignorant douchebag with a big ego and an inferiority complex. They don’t care, because when we get other people angry with threats and violence, they don’t even bother to think about how much less freedom they have than us. They don’t want our control, either. They have enough authority, control, and emotional issues to deal with in their own country. When we kill the brothers, sisters, neighbors, children, wives, husbands and friends of people in other countries, it doesn’t matter if we do these things in the name of freedom. There is no such thing as collateral damage without responsibility. Killing other people doesn’t free the people that love them. It hurts very badly to lose people that we love. It doesn’t matter what kind of results we obtain. It’s a childish, egotistical, calloused, and dumb way to treat other people. When we kill other people, they want to kill us. That’s the bottom line. We cannot solve problems for other people on the planet, but we can be more loving, peaceful, and relaxed with other countries. We can set a positive example for other people worldwide of how a country SHOULD be: creative, fun, spiritual, humble, peaceful, and loving. We can also defend ourselves if other countries become too aggressive towards us and take this attitude for granted. That is our right. We cannot change the world around us, but we can influence it, and we can change ourselves. The only control that any of us have is our own attitude towards other people. If we have a negative and threatening one, we know what the results will be. It’s time to get real about it.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts8eWIy7Gsc ","second_level_comments": {"comment1": {"author":"Gargomon251","time":"1506310902.0","score":"1","id":"dngabvd","body":" Cool copypasta bro ","third_level_comments": {}}}}}},"post13": {"title":"Dammit Schrodinger","author":"runningSalmon","time":"1506293087.0","score":"4368","id":"725ebh","url":"https://i.redd.it/29lbvi0kfunz.jpg","all_comments": {"comment1": {"author":"msiekkinen","time":"1506295529.0","score":"175","id":"dnfvtrr","body":" USB C connectors solve this problem ","second_level_comments": {"comment1": {"author":"DicktheMagician","time":"1506309679.0","score":"105","id":"dng92rs","body":" Looking at the USB before you plug it in collapses the wavefunction, and also solves this problem.

As the finesse in my movements is extremely absent, I experience the smashing of glasses very often. To achieve a perfect smash like this one, the glass must receive a sharp spike of kenetic energy from an external force, or usually in my case, the glass has an instant reduction of its kenetic energy due to its impact of a stationary force. This is usually due to freefall. Fun facts: Fuck fuck fuck - very shortly before the impact this phrase is commonly heard in ones head but is usually not said out loud. Listen out for it if you are the smash-initiating individual.For fuck sake - This phrase is very commonly used by the individual who has initiated the smashing, said out loud once the smash has completed its spread. How the fuck did you manage that? - This phrase is very commonly used from a third party individual who has witnessed the smash by the primary initiation individual.Fucking idiot - This phrase is very commonly muttered in low volume from a 3rd individual who has perhaps heard the smash from a distance but has no involvement in the cleaning process of the smash.

Edit: I actually think timber construction might be more expensive, not cheaper, in other parts of the world. Maybe even here, to be honest.

Hes mocking the grunge marble mouthed vocal styling of Cobain. This would fall under fair use.Eat It is not a parody of Beat It. It just sounds like Beat It and is about food.

White liberals (writers, journalists, etc.) themselves are engaged in appeasing this black social protest, as they often do (see: the Michael Brown or Trayvon Martin cases) by accepting false and misleading narratives.

Feel free to copy paste whatever, free to use, obviously the numbers were for when I wrote it12.3 % population are blacks /22.4% of violent crime63 % population are whites /42.9% of violent crimeBlacks: 22.4/12.3 = 1.82 (overrepresented) Whites : 42.9/63 = .68 (underrepresented)Now lets see who gets killed more by copsso far this year we are up to 574 whites and 266 blacks out of a total 1092574/1092 = 52% 266/1092 = 24%To get a representation lets ask how much crime you do gets punished by cops , call it Crime Justice Index (CJI) , if you account for 50% the crime but incurred only 1/10th the deathbycop, you would be sitting pretty with a score of .5/.1 = 5. Conversely if you do 1/10th the crime but account for 90% of the deathbycop , you would be unfairly shot down with a score of .1/.9= .111. Ergo a high CJI means cops are shooting you less for what crimes you are doing, and a low CJI means cops are shooting you more unfairly.CJI for blacks = 1.82/.24 = 7.58 CJI for whites = .68/.52 =1.31So how much more are whites getting killed by police? 7.85/1.31 =5.78fold higher.Some concessions : Using statistics from a few years back , though you can check, it hasnt changed much between the races in decades.

Lik the one time Ricky said said theres probably like no good !!!! i was agreeing so much Iam smarter then youre average fidget spinner teen at middle school to even though I have one. I may be young but Im smarter then every theist on earth basically the show is also really deep when they said like no one was born for a reason I was so blown away as they must have big balls to say that on tv so I told my friends on minecraft and they agree too. LOL once when my mom took me to McDonalds I asked for the Mulan dipping sauce and the dumb bitch didnt even get the reference XD One time in class i evan shouted Im PICKLE RIIIICK! and Mrs.Janice told me to go outside i fucking hate that cunt school is for dumb ppl just like what Rick said, i m too smart for such imbicells.

The humor is extremely suble, and without a solid grasp of comedic theory most of the jokes will go over a typical readers head. Theres also the posters cynical outlook, which is deftly woven into the writing. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of this meme, to realize its not just funny- it says something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike the Rick and Morty copypasta truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldnt appreciate, for instance, the humour in the copypastas existential cul de sac of course they wouldnt appreciate, for instance, the humour in Ricks existencial catchphrase Wubba Lubba Dub Dub, which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenevs Russian epic Fathers and Sons, which itself is a cryptic meta-reference to Turgenevs Russian epic Fathers and Sons.

Maybe theres someone out there who understands the cartoons subtle humor better than you do (and by that I mean that such a person may be smarter than you), but that person might not think that those jokes are as amusing as you find them, simply because their overall interests do not match Rick and Mortys intellectual themes.Edit: Fixed some grammatical issues.

No one should ever be afraid to question a scientific theory, for fear of being ostracised as a denier or other such term (which has become the equivalent of being branded a heretic). If anything, this demand for dogmatic thinking makes me think that these theories are far less sound than scientists like Tyson are willing to admit. Criticism and review is a core part of the scientific process and should be expected for all theories - especially important/mainstream ones with far-reaching implications. If the theory is sound, then the criticism will be shown to be baseless. Hence, when scientists begin demanding that their theories not be criticised, the most obvious reason for them to do this is that they know there are legitimate criticisms to be made. I would also question whether allowing science to influence politics is a good idea. There are already countless issues with scientific studies being conducted in a heavily-biased manner, in order to get a result that supports a particular agenda.

Instead, they would eat things like nuts, berries, pine needles, tree bark, and resin (which is why the diet of the sokushinbutsu was called mokujikyo, or tree-eating. Over time, the diet would become more restrictive, starving the body of nutrients and eliminating the fat and moisture that can encourage bodily decay after death; X-rays of sokushinbutsu have even shown river stones in the guts of mummies. Jeremiah suggests that, beyond the weight loss, some aspects of the diet may have helped with the preservation of the body after death. For example, certain herbs and toxic cycad nuts may have inhibited bacterial growth. And at least some sokushinbutsu are said to have drunk a tea made from urushi, the sap of Toxicodendron vernicifluum, which is typically used to make lacquer. In addition to facilitating vomiting, the urushi may have functioned as a sort of embalming fluid, rendering the body toxic to potential flesh-eating invaders.I dont really see whats so crazy or unpleasant about it.

Do it on your own time (which this guy is but the athletes arent).2. The Democrats that support this are the same people that feel that punching someone in the face for having a differing (non-PC) opinion is perfectly acceptable, or champion hounding someone out of a job for a non-PC Tweet.  Their newfound support of free speech seems utterly disingenuous.  Their problem with McCarthyism wasnt the lack of free speech but that it was directed against them.3. This is really about telling Middle America to go fuck itself.  As if subjecting them to Hate Speech by calling them bitter clingers, deplorables and constantly screaming racist!! at them wasnt enough, they have to tell Middle America they shit on their values at every opportunity.4. This is totalitarian.  The Left wants politics to invalid every sphere of activity.  They told us in the 70s that the personal was political and they have worked hard to make it so.  Work, sports, entertainment all must have a tinge of politics to it.  Everything inside the state; nothing outside the state.  The place that people used to rest and forget about the worries of the world cannot longer exist in the Lefts totalitarian worldview.  Your daily entertainment, your weekend sports cannot just be about sitting their having a drink and vegging out, no it must include your [Daily Hate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Minutes_Hate), your act of political ablution.5. It is a win-win for The Left.  As the multi-millionaire athletes and owners support this, they get to tell Middle America that they dont like them or their values.  As Middle America leaves the sport (like they have left ESPN and are leaving the NFL) then a sport that the Left hates is injured and sidelined.>  But if you ask this former fan, the rot runs deeper. Football, which is practically the state religion in Texas and across the South, used to be closely tied up with patriotism and love of country. The militaristic component of the sport, which was presented as akin to war, appealed especially to red-state dwellers. But sportscasters and sportswriters are overwhelmingly leftist in their outlook, and their eagerness to turn Kaepernick into a civil-rights icon has repelled a sizable section of football’s core audience — and one that, by the current evidence is growing.People like to pretend Leftism isnt driving things and that the all mightily dollar rules, but look at ESPN.  Billionaires and multi-millionaires are willing to burn a few million in stock value to advance their politics.>  All ESPN had to do, a couple of years ago, was say ‘we do sports, politics are for those other cable channels.’ That would have drawn in the many Americans who are sick of 24/7/365 politics. Instead, ESPN decided to do politics, but with less balance than MSNBC. Shockingly, this has not drawn more people in.

The explicit numerical methods  used there can become unstable if the parameters go outside of certain ranges. You can fix this by reducing the time step or using higher order methods. But that is often not an option in games for performance reasons. Physics in games is really more about how much can we cheat before the player can tell the difference than actual realism.So it is easier to just limit the possible positions/speeds etc. to safe limits and live with some wonky physics instead of the the whole simulation blowing up.Something similar probably also causes the strange rotational behavior.

I am an avid gamer and love a lot of the worlds that cosplayers often portray. However, I somehow feel that playing and enjoying the badass characters is really awesome. But seeing some kid dressed as the Lich King or an adult dressed as Batman is kind of over the top. Maybe, because theres rarely anything beyond the costume. The Lich King is this poisonous, powerful being that bleeds of character, coldness and pure might. Harley Quinn is a psychotic maniac that is constantly torn between her good and clever girl; and the batshit crazy inside of her. Yet, what you get in cosplay is the Lich King standing there like a dumbass, and a Harley that shows off a huge cleavage in a tight corset. I agree, the costumes are often really good.

Cracking skulls on walls or throwing bricks at peoples faces added creativity and personality to your fighting style. The mechanics felt smooth, simple and effective, which is what you want in a fighting game. The rage system was the cherry on top when brawling. Ill finish off with the replay ability. Its graphics are rockstars classic quality mid 2000s; basically it was shit even for its time. Thats the only negative.

It’s basically what PlayStation Now does now (more on that in a second). OnLive was one of the first companies out of the gate with this service and you could buy games a la carte or subscribe to an all you can eat service. I was a subscriber for a bit and I think they even sent me this box but obviously I never used it — I played on PC and Mac, since it was so great to run high end pc games on my little MacBook.Eventually OnLive’s founders left I think, once they realized that the plan wasn’t going to reach critical mass. The new management made some very consumer unfriendly moves and at that point it was all over.In an interesting ending, one of onlive’s biggest competitors was Gaikai, a company which also hosted streaming games and was eventually bought by Sony and the tech was turned into PlayStation Now. When OnLive went under they were trying to unload the assets, and Sony picked them up as well, probably for a bargain price. OnLive definitely didn’t make it but if PS Now ever takes off, something of both Gaikai and OnLive might still survive!

They often have the animals for longer periods, are paying for transport, staff, marketing. Theyre smaller operations so they dont have vets on staff, so theyre paying nearly full price for veterinary care -- additionally, shelters are usually subsidized by local governments whereas rescues are not, contributing to higher adoption costs. In return, you get an animal that usually has been put in foster care, socialized, put through a more rigorous veterinary and behavioral test, and are marketed in such a way that you will see them (via Facebook, adoption fairs, etc.).

He has had cubs aspirate from improper bottle feeding, he forces animals into stressful situations because they need to learn to be friends, he enters enclosures with large, adult big cats and physically interacts with them, he forces multiple individuals of multiple species into cohabitation, there are trenches at the edges of his enclosures from incessant pacing from his cats.  His overall outlook and philosophy on sanctuary, conservation, and wildlife are completely backwards.      Hes always boasting about some half-baked conservation project and how its the first or best of its kind, yet he has no understanding of the research involved or how to conduct biological surveys to see if such projects are even viable.Hes also just a shitty person.  He lies *constantly*.  He is juvenile, deceiving, arrogant, and he blocks or slanders anyone who approaches him with legitimate questions or concerns about his operation.

The novelty of having a dog/puppy runs out in time and if you havent formed habits by that point, it can be quite difficult.High energy and intelligent dogs like Collies can also be destructive if not exercised enough.

We eventually moved out when I was little and he remained living with my grandpa , but I swear he was always so excited to see me. He was a simple guard dog/outdoors dog whose life’s happiness was for you to play fetch with him (he’d find a rock and bring it to you for that purpose). I’ve heard about how GSDs can be dangerous without training but I’m pretty sure no one trained Ajax much yet he has been, of all dogs I’ve had, the most gentle with children. He was truly a special dog.Now that I think about it I think my experience with him colored more than my view of GSDs, he colored my view of all dogs.

There is still a lack of evidence that vitamins in general do much for people, however in specific instances, vitamins can help. A vitamin a day has not shown to lead to better or longer health, in fact the opposite seems more likely from meta studies. However the addition of folic acid (folate) to many foods in modern times, has led to vast decreases in cases of spina bifida (caused by a lack of folic acid during pregnancy). Vitamin C and scurvy is another edge case indicating the value of specific supplements.As long as nutrients are bio-available, they may be good to supplement for specific case scenarios, and particularly when pregnant; many doctors suggest supplements to ensure ones (and the babys) nutritional needs are met (particularly with regard to trace minerals critical during gestation). So Western allopaths pretty much always recommend vitamins during pregnancy, *in addition to* a healthful diet.

Occasionally a store might have extra space in an aisle then others in its area and the stores just fill the empty space with whatever it has excess in its stockroom. Walgreens assigns each manager certain departments to be in charge of and they have to manage the excess inventory, when you have too much product, you find ways to work them in to B space.

Todd had asked Stephanie, you know, the one from Bio 115 to come through and even though he never thought she would, she did. Not only that, but she came CORRECT.  Talkin bout the tightest jeans youve ever seen, perfectly cupping her supple behind. She had on this lacey little shirt too. Ooh! But let me not get carried away. So she came through with her girls, and that livend things up a bit. I aint gonna lie, I fuck with Todd and them, But shit was a sausage fest beforehand, and if I had to hear Seth REMIND us that it was one more time, I was gonna kill that motherfucker. But I digress. Todd, whos dad used to be a bartender, worked the bar most of the night, mixing up some shit with whatever it was we picked up at Walgreens. He chatted it up with Stephanie, Occasionally stepping off duty to bust a boogie with his girl haha and as the night winds down, we start pairing off. I got to spend some time with this Latina thing with prettiest eyes youve ever seen! And her pus- well, yall aint here for me, you here to hear Todds story, right? Well, as was hoped, he somehow got his tongue off the floor and back into his mouth long enough to say the right shit to her, cause he actually got to use those fuckin condoms he bought. Only problem was, brother got the wrong size. Thought he was a bigger man then he was haha ended up bein like a worm navigatin a trash bag - bleak outcome, uncomfortable as shit, and a shit place to bust your nut. And you KNOW his excited ass busted quick. Well... he didnt actually say that in the story when HE told it, but... cmon. Fuckin Todd, Man. So Todds dumb ass figures, I would totally anchor-baby this chick but... thats a dick move so he figures hell go back to walgreens to get the plan B. Only problem is, his ass been drinking all night and he cant even walk crooked, let alone drive a car. But then he remembered! We picked it up as a laugh, but he fuckin remembered. The breathalyzer. Motherfucker had the girl of his dreams upstairs, but he was on his hands and knees shuffling through beer cans, seths vomit... well thats probably it, but fuck that shit regardless. He eventually found it, but the fucker realized he didnt know how to fuckin read it. Didnt know what was good or bad level, but he figured since the text was green he was good... and he was... until about a street over where he crashed his Charger into a telephone pole. Now, dont worry! It was a stupid choice, he knows! Thankfully, no one got hurt, and he was so drunk he kinda... I guess the medical term would be ragdolled? I dont know, but basically his ass was so drunk, that  when he crashed his body was relaxed and he aint tense up. Maybe the only reason he alive... But also he probably wouldnt have crashed if he didnt DnD... But I digress. Cops come, that whole thang happened. Theh brethalize bim and bes like, yeah, thats whats it was sayin at home! Told you i wasGood. Bruuhhh. Brotha had to pay for all this shit right? But, besides the bills, since no one was hurt, they let him go pretty quick. Which is both cool and whack, but Im too close and too black to this situation for that topic right now, so movin on. Dude ubers back, since his whip crashed, and gues what?

They allow you something like 30 doctor visits a year for free, then after that you have to pay. And the pharmacy was in the same place as the waiting room, so the second I was done they printed my pill packet strip out of a machine, and said I owe 80NTD (about $2.50) for the pills. I also got a waiting number before the visit, waited maybe 30 mins, very clean and professional clinic, doctor spoke perfect English, as did every doctor I visited in Taiwan. She asked me questions about my condition (I had a bad cold) and then she gave me an application of minty throat-numbing spray for free, before handing my pharmacy ticket to the pharmacists located 15 feet away, who printed off my packets in about 3 minutes. It was one of the least expensive, and yet most professional and streamlined, visits Ive had with a doctors office.Another time I got an ear infection on a trip while in England. The doctors visit was free because of the NHS, and took about 15 minutes total, I dont even remember waiting at all. The pharmacy was downstairs in the same building, they gave me the ear medicine and my aunt paid like $8 for it. It was just so... easy. As was Taiwan, even without speaking a lick of Chinese. I looked up every pill in that packet strip on the internet out of curiosity, and I only took about 1/4 of them that treated the symptoms that were actually bothering me, but they had all sorts of ailment cures included in these packets. These two experiences showed me how bad the US system is. Its so expensive and slow. I once got a bad stomach ulcer and waited 12 _hours_ in a US emergency room, and the doctor gave me pepto bismol as treatment and I had to pay hundreds for the experience... By contrast the free health clinic in Taiwan was 1/4 a mile from my brand new apartment with marble floors that cost $400/mo. Life was just so easy when I lived there, for so many reasons.

One of the other guests then mentioned he kept his cutlery AND beer mug in a cubbyhole in the back as did many regulars.. The same went for beer mugs in two of the pubs except those you paid for and you owned them which got around any awkward questions. The absolutely ridiculous thing was at the time the food was cooked and served by blacks the drinks were poured by blacks and the washing up was done by blacks and although apartheid was over the integration had yet to start  especially in places like this where regulars were 95% of the business so the chances of you getting a contaminated  item was very low but such was the hysteria in certain parts of New South Africa on the late 90s.

Their toes can get caught in the slits and the ball bends their back in a way that strains it. Theyre very poorly ventilated and knocking the ball against things can cause them very grave sometimes fatal injuries. Its difficult to see from inside a hamster ball and they can become very stressed and freaked out from the inability to orient themselves. In Germany (known for their humane pet laws) hamster balls are listed as unsuitable animal supplies with high injury risksAn alternative would be to make a rodent run using cardboard and old blankets or something so the animal can run freely, but safely.
