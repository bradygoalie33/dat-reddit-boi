One morning, a red-tailed hawk was perched on a high tree, and caught and fed on a mourning dove that was feeding.Anyway for the next few days or so, the hawk would perch on the top of the tree, but the other birds left the area, apparently fearing being the next meal. We had a small group of blue jays that would feed, and apparently they had enough. They started congregating about 10 feet below the perched hawk, and started screaming at and dive bombing the hawk.It seems that hawks need the element of surprise and gliding down to reach speeds that would catch unwary prey. The jays completely intimidated the hawk, and eventually, the hawk decided to try to find easier hunting grounds.
