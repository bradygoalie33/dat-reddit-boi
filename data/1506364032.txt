Humans are slow, weak, imperceptive animals who genetically traded off physical prowess for gigantic, high-maintenance brains that would let us build equipment to overcome our physical shortcomings. When we match our advantages against the evolved strengths of our prey, hunting is absolutely a sport.There are situations in which it becomes less of a sport and more of a harvest. Dick Cheney-style hunting, where they plant tame birds along a trail and you walk along and shoot them, isnt really a sport. But at the opposite extreme, hiking 35 miles through untracked mountain wilderness with a 60-pound backpack in search of a mature Dall ram, which can spot you from miles away and climb cliffs like Alex Hannold, is as sporting as it gets. It takes a lot of equipment and knowledge just to put a human in a position to survive a trip like that, let alone kill a ram. The playing field is vastly tilted in the rams favor.

One morning, a red-tailed hawk was perched on a high tree, and caught and fed on a mourning dove that was feeding.Anyway for the next few days or so, the hawk would perch on the top of the tree, but the other birds left the area, apparently fearing being the next meal. We had a small group of blue jays that would feed, and apparently they had enough. They started congregating about 10 feet below the perched hawk, and started screaming at and dive bombing the hawk.It seems that hawks need the element of surprise and gliding down to reach speeds that would catch unwary prey. The jays completely intimidated the hawk, and eventually, the hawk decided to try to find easier hunting grounds.

It was a little past noon and every time the bird dived, George would shift a little bit to the right. My Dad didnt know what George was doing, but he watched and soon enough, George showed his cards. The Blue Jay went for another dive and George jumped up, spun around and plucked the Jay right out of the sky.

He was all black; I named him Shadow.I remember bringing it in when it crawled under my car one night and I didnt want it to get hurt when I started it the next morning--it was the winter and cats are known to sleep near the warm engine block, sometimes leading to...not good things when the car starts.We had it for about nine years, if my memory serves right. He was always a cuddler, to the point of annoyance. I had never met a cat who was so insistent on getting so close to your face.Last week my brother told me he had stopped eating and he had a feeding tube put in. I knew it was nearing the end--he was simply preparing for the end of his life. The next day he told me he was gone. I hadnt seen him for close to two years--I live halfway across the country now.Fuck, man, I didnt expect to care so much about that cat.
